# WearMade

## Project Title: WearMade - A Custom Tailoring Platform  

## Project Idea & Description  
WearMade is a platform designed to revolutionize custom tailoring by bridging the gap between customers and tailors. Instead of booking appointments and visiting tailoring shops, users can conveniently upload their measurements and design requirements online. Tailors then review the requests and provide an estimated cost and completion time. This streamlines the process, making custom clothing more accessible and efficient. 

## How It Works  

1. **Customer Uploads Requirements:** Users provide their clothing measurements, fabric preferences, and design inspirations through the platform.  
2. **Tailor Reviews and Provides Estimate:** Tailors receive the request, analyze the requirements, and respond with an estimated cost and delivery timeline.  
3. **Customer Confirms the Order & Makes Payment:** Once a suitable estimate is provided, the customer confirms the order and makes the payment through Razorpay.  
4. **Tailor Completes and Delivers the Order:** The tailor works on the outfit and delivers it within the agreed timeframe.  
5. **Tailor Uploads Completed & Sample Works:** Tailors can showcase their completed works and sample designs in their portfolio for future customers to view.  
6. **Customer Reviews & Rates Tailor:** After receiving the final product, customers can leave a review and rating based on their experience.
